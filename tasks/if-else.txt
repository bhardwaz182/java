Class:

Define a class Rectangle with instance variables length and breadth
define methods to set length and breadth and to get length and breadth
define a method area that prints area of reactangle length*breadth



Define a class Shape with lenght and breadth as instance variables 
define methods to set lenght and breadth and to get length and breadth 
define a method area in shape class 
define another class reactangle and square inherit from the shape and override area method 
which should return area of the shape
